# MarvelCharactersAPI

This project is bult with React and allows the user to search for a marvel character within the marvel database and in return be displayed the typed in character’s name, bio and image using the marvel API and styling help using SCSS.

#### How to use
- **May be some characters that are not available to be seen** 
-	Type In a marvel character into input and information of desired character will be returned.

## What I Learnt
I can see why react is very popular, showing me hooks and how it makes working with components easier and help change the value of a state condition. Got a great insight on how useEffect works I had to read upon on what it can do and through this knew it was imperative especially working with an api.

It is my first time using sass and it has made me realise how efficient it is to style an app. It’s also much tidier and more organised thus being a big help when re-visiting for any future modifications.

I found it easier to use git to add content to my repository. I did run into a few origin master issues but I managed to research the problem and resolve it.  

To prevent all the characters being displayed at one time I had to visit a developer web doc to know how to solve this and so I found map() and slice() methods. Both allowed me to display and pick out one character from the index of items from the array returned.

## Improvements for future features
- Could have created another page for api endpoints url’s to make page cleaner and insert said url’s into app.js page via a const call.

- Feel there is a lack of useaility, an erase feature on input box could be implemented to make it easier for user to erase content within the input box rather than have to delete everything from input box via backspace.

- Make the look of the card much cleaner and professional, add more styling for example box shadow would give more of an out of the screen effect just like a comic.

- Make the app responsive to all devices, even though the intention wasn’t to make it responsive. I know it will look more professional if it was as the issue currently is that on some devices the alignment makes it hard for users to see all displayed information.
